    "summary": "Long-tenured paper-industry leader with a career beginning April 1992 at Dunder Mifflin and culminating in years as regional manager of the Scranton branch. Recognized in-episode for elite sales performance (Top Salesman awards), high-impact client acquisition, and branch performance strong enough to draw corporate attention. Demonstrated entrepreneurial initiative by founding a competing paper company and negotiating a return-to-company outcome that included reinstatement and benefits. Known for high-energy culture programming, internal awards events, and extensive creative output (film, parody songwriting).",
